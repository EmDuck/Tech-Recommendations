| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Arctic Freezer 34 CO               | $30          | Tower | Old but gold. It has a sharp heatsink that will cut your fingers if you're not careful.
| ID-COOLING SE-214-XT               | $20          | Tower | Amazing price-to performance cooler. Cheapest RGB tower cooler that doesn't suck.
| ID-COOLING SE-224-XT               | $30          | Tower | A great step-up from the SE-214-XT.

| Deepcool AK400                     | $35          | Tower | Basically a mini AK620. Performs amazingly for just $35.
| Deepcool AK620                     | $70          | Tower | One of the best air coolers in its league.
| Deepcool Gammaxx 400/V2            | $20-$25      | Tower | Another forgotten cooler. Legendary during its time. Though, the stock blue LED fan is disgusting imo. | | Deepcool Gammaxx GT/V2/GTE/GTE V2  | $30-$40      | Tower | RGB Gammaxx 400.
| Thermalright Frost Spirit 140      | $50          | Tower | Quite a step-up from the smaller Peerless Assassin 120. It's like the older brother.

| Vetroo V5                          | $30          | Tower | One of the best sellers on Amazon. Also has 5 heatpipes instead of the usual 4.

| Cooler Master Hyper 212 (All of them) | $50          | Black-Silver | All of the Hyper 212 coolers are overpriced. The EVO uses sleeve bearing fans, the worst bearing. $50 is insane for the performance of the **ID-COOLING SE-214-XT**, a $20 cooler.

#### Water Coolers

| Alphacool Eisbaer/Aurora       | $            | 
| Arctic Liquid Freezer II/A-RGB | $100-$150    | 120mm/240mm/280mm/360mm/420mm | One of the best price-to-performance AIOs out there. Sometimes you can find a 240mm on sale for **$70-$90**. Not to mention, the fans have dual-ball bearings so they'll last a good amount of years. |
| EK-AIO Basic/D-RGB             | $            | 120mm/240mm/280mm/360mm       | Gorgeous black AIO, gorgeous RGB AIO. Even better, it performs as well as the Galahad AIO.
| Lian Li Galahad AIO            | $            | 240mm/360mm                   | Great performing AIO,
